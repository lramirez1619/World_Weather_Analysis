WeatherPy with Python APIs

Background
PlanMyTrip is Jack's favorite app. Even the beta testers adore it. They've also suggested a few tweaks to advance the software, like with any new product. They advise including including the weather description with the weather data.
To complete this challenge, the PlanMyTrip app will need to be improved using the weather description data already obtained in this module. The data will then be filtered for the beta testers' preferred weather, which will be used to discover potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential vacation spots, the beta tester will select four cities to include in their itinerary. Next, you'll design a route between the four using the Geoapify Routing API.

Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
